		#CGI STUFF???

		# basically a way to run run script as the specified extension wich is
		# given below
		#
		# We're given the path as PATH_INFO of it's location
		#
		# the cgi ill be executed by a fork() with the script to run as first
		# argument
		#	guess we should use PATH_INFO as directory to find the script
		#
		#


		# wikipedia says

		# As remarked above, the CGI specification defines how additional
		# information passed with the request is passed to the script. For instance, if
		# a slash and additional directory name(s) are appended to the URL immediately
		# after the name of the script (in this example, /with/additional/path), then
		# that path is stored in the PATH_INFO environment variable before
	    # the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an
		# HTTP GET request (a question mark appended to the URL, followed by param=value
		# pairs; in the example, ?and=a&query=string), then those parameters
		# are stored in the QUERY_STRING environment variable before the script is
		# called. If parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP POST request, they
		# are passed to the script's standard input. The script can then read these
		# environment variables or data from standard input and adapt to the Web browser'
		# s request.[7]
